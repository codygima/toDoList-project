# React To-Do List

## Overview
This to-do list was created using exclusively React plus Vite. The code is relatively simple with implementations of React. This website primarily uses JSX (JavaScript + XML) and CSS. I watched [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh3tobg7hEo) for a basic tutorial and understanding of React.

**If you want to look at the finished website, here is the URL: https://codygima.github.io/toDoList-project/**

## Prerequisites
+ [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
+ Vite, can be done by running this command on your terminal: `npm install -D vite`
+ [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)

## Installation and Usage
To install React To-Do List, make sure you installed all the prerequisites to your computer, then open your local terminal and run the following commands:

1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/codygima/toDoList-project.git
```
2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
```bash
cd toDoList-project
```
3. Open Visual Studio Code:
```bash
code .
```
### In the terminal within VS Code run the rest of the commands:
4. Run the Program:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Copy the Local URL:

In the terminal there should be a URL that you can use to host the website using your local browser. The URL should look something like, http://localhost:3000.

Now you will be able to view and make changes to the code to see how it affects the user interface hopefully helping you get familiar with React!
