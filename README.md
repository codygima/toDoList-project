# React To-Do List

## Overview
This to-do list was created using exclusively React plus Vite. The code is relatively simple with implementations of React. This website primarily uses JSX (JavaScript + XML) and CSS. I watched [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh3tobg7hEo) for a basic tutorial and understanding of React.

**If you want to look at the finished website, here is the URL: https://codygima.github.io/toDoList-project/**

## Prerequisites
+ [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
+ Vite, can be done by running this command on your terminal: `npm install -D vite`
+ [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)

## Installation and Usage
To install React To-Do List, make sure you installed all the prerequisites to your computer, then open your local terminal and run the following commands:

1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/codygima/toDoList-project.git

```
3. Open Visual Studio Code:
```bash
code .
